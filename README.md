Here in this project the ojective is to detect the number of particles in the results obtained as AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) of VO2 substrates.
The particles were detected using a python code, with slight parameter enhancements for three different samples VO2_Si, VO2_SiO2, and VO2_TiO2.
Finally the density of the particles was used as a correlation to compare the three substrates.
